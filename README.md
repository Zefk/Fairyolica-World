# Fairyolica-World v0.1 Outside/Exterior

**About:**

This is a graphic pack that I am putting together for the Solarus Engine as a hobby. The outside world is completed, but progress will slow down because of my many other hobbies. It is quite large and most of it is free under CC-BY-SA 3.0 unless marked otherwise. Some sprites are just free and I do not have the rights to change their license, but they can still be in the Fairyolica World pack.

My only plan was to make an outside world, but that changed because I want setup more graphics for this package. That is why it is now alpha instead of beta.

**Contact:**

Contact me on the [Solarus forum](http://forum.solarus-games.org/index.php?topic=653.msg3313#msg3313) or make an issue if you want to help with this project. I can give you the resources. All you have to do is set them up. You can check out a few chapters in a book I am making to help you. [Chapter-3](https://github.com/Zefk/Solarus-ARPG-Game-Development-Book_2/blob/master/seperated_chapters/done/6_chapter-3.md), [Chapter-4](https://github.com/Zefk/Solarus-ARPG-Game-Development-Book_2/blob/master/seperated_chapters/done/7_chapter-4.md), [Chapter-5](https://github.com/Zefk/Solarus-ARPG-Game-Development-Book_2/blob/master/seperated_chapters/done/8_chapter-5.md), and [Chapter-11](https://github.com/Zefk/Solarus-ARPG-Game-Development-Book_2/blob/master/seperated_chapters/done/14_chapter-11.md). Some fixes and additions are being added to these chapters because the book is only alpha.

Bugs are fixed after completion of a version. That means all bugs reported for v1.0 will be fixed in v1.1 or if others wish to fix the issues, then there will be minor releases like v1.0.1, v1.0.2, etc. Those would mean only bug fixes.

**Status:** 

-Fairolica World outside v1.0 [Complete]

**Next Release:** 

v0.1 Plain Dungeon

**Later Releases:**

-v0.2 Dungeon Skinning and texturing

-v0.3 Inside House tiles or interior

-v0.4 Tileset entities

-v0.5 Sprite characters

-v0.6 Font .tff packages

-v0.7 Scripts - This will be pseudocode like code. I have not decided on actually correcting the syntax or making the scripts function.
