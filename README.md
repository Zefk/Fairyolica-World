# Fairyolica-World v0.1 Outside/Exterior

**About:**

This is a graphic pack that I am putting together for the Solarus Engine as a hobby. The outside world is completed. It is quite large and most of it is free under CC-BY-SA 3.0 unless marked otherwise. Some sprites are just free and I do not have the rights to change their license, but they can still be in the Fairyolica World pack.

**License:** 

Most of it is free under CC-BY-SA 3.0 unless [marked otherwise.](https://github.com/Zefk/Fairyolica-World/blob/master/LICENSE.md)

That means it is free for commercial and non-commercial use.

**Reports:**

Post issues in the issue section. You will need a github account. It is free afterall.
