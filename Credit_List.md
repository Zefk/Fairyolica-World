##Faryolica World Credits:

The Fariryolica world tileset is mostly under CC-BY-SA 3.0. Unless marked otherwise here. Some sprites are just free and I do not have the rights to change their license, but they can still be in the Fairyolica World pack.

###About:

============================================================================================================================
1.The bullet "•" means it is a person and the way they want to be credited.

2.This is organized by license type. CC0, CC-BY 3.0, CC-BY-SA 3.0.

3.CC0 is not required for crediting, but I added them anyway.

4.Go into the orginal graphics for more detailed credits for each folder with related links.

5.Yes, all these licenses are compatible with each other, but the end result is CC-BY-SA 3.0 and you must credit everyone if you use the Fariyolica png. That means the CC0 people too.

6.I refined this list a little. 11-14-16 [Novemeber 14th, 2016]
