Rather than letting this pretty artwork waste away hidden on a rusty old hard drive, I thought someone out there might be able to use them, so please, help yourself.

If you decide to use any of these tilesheets, please let us know by dropping a comment here (though you certainly don’t have to). We’d love to see them find a home in a game somewhere. If you need some more in a matching style to finish your game, let us know as well and we might be able to take care of you.

**Notice:**

There site is down. Most likely the company hit hard times. Here is a link I could find. <http://urbansquall.newgrounds.com/>
